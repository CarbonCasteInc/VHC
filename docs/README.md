# Documentation Index

This repository's documentation is organized into three primary groups:

- `docs/foundational` — architecture, status, policy contracts, runtime constants, role guardrails.
- `docs/specs` — canonical technical specs and protocol/data model documents.
- `docs/sprints` — sprint plans, implementation notes, and archived sprint artifacts.
