# News Aggregator Production Service

> Status: Operational Runbook
> Owner: VHC Ops
> Last Reviewed: 2026-06-14
> Depends On: docs/ops/NEWS_SOURCE_ADMISSION_RUNBOOK.md, docs/ops/public-feed-freshness-monitor.md, docs/ops/analysis-backend-3001.md, docs/ops/public-beta-launch-readiness-closeout.md

## Purpose

This runbook packages the existing `@vh/news-aggregator` daemon as the managed
production publisher. It does not introduce a second publisher path.

The daemon is continuous, not one-shot: `services/news-aggregator/src/daemon.ts`
starts the news runtime after acquiring the ingestion lease, renews leadership on
an interval, keeps product-feed reconciliation and pending synthesis catch-up on
their own intervals, and exits only when the process receives SIGINT/SIGTERM or
startup fails closed.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not start production publisher writes without explicit operator approval.
- Do not run public latest-index HTTP reads until the #638 relay code is proven
  deployed on the host.
- Keep public-feed monitors disabled until relay deploy proof, safe validation,
  analysis health/config, publisher freshness, and canary/soak gates are green.
- Store secrets only in host env files outside git. Record env var names, host,
  port, and artifact paths only.

## Managed Units

Templates:

- `infra/systemd/user/vh-news-aggregator.service`
- `infra/systemd/user/vh-relay-snapshot-freshness-watch.service`
- `infra/systemd/user/vh-relay-snapshot-freshness-watch.timer`

Installer:

```bash
cd /home/humble/VHC
./tools/scripts/install-news-aggregator-production-service.sh
```

The installer writes user units and reloads systemd. It does not start publisher
writes by default.

Host runtime prerequisite observed on A6 on 2026-06-14: `node` is available at
`/home/humble/.local/bin/node`, while `pnpm` was not installed for `humble`.
Install the repo-pinned pnpm before enabling publisher services:

```bash
bash -lc 'npm install -g pnpm@9.7.1'
bash -lc 'node -v && pnpm -v'
```

Read-only relay snapshot watch timer:

```bash
./tools/scripts/install-news-aggregator-production-service.sh --enable-watch
systemctl --user status vh-relay-snapshot-freshness-watch.timer --no-pager
journalctl --user -u vh-relay-snapshot-freshness-watch.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

Approved publisher start packet:

```bash
cd /home/humble/VHC
git fetch origin main
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
./tools/scripts/install-news-aggregator-production-service.sh
VH_NEWS_DAEMON_START_APPROVED=1 ./tools/scripts/install-news-aggregator-production-service.sh --start-publisher
systemctl --user status vh-news-aggregator.service --no-pager
journalctl --user -u vh-news-aggregator.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

Abort / kill switch:

```bash
systemctl --user stop vh-news-aggregator.service
systemctl --user disable vh-news-aggregator.service
journalctl --user -u vh-news-aggregator.service -n 200 --no-pager
```

Rollback:

```bash
cd /home/humble/VHC
git fetch origin main
git checkout <known-good-commit>
./tools/scripts/install-news-aggregator-production-service.sh
systemctl --user restart vh-news-aggregator.service
```

## Startup Gates

`tools/scripts/start-news-aggregator-daemon-production.sh` is the only
`ExecStart` entrypoint for the managed publisher service. It fails closed unless:

1. `VH_NEWS_DAEMON_ENV_FILE` is readable.
2. `pnpm check:news-sources:health` passes with release-evidence enforcement.
3. `pnpm --filter @vh/storycluster-engine build` passes.
4. `preflightOpenAIStoryClusterProviderFromEnv` returns `status: "pass"`.

After these pass, the wrapper writes
`VH_NEWS_DAEMON_LAST_SUCCESS_FILE` or
`$VH_NEWS_DAEMON_STATE_DIR/last-success.json`, then `exec`s:

```bash
pnpm --filter @vh/news-aggregator daemon
```

The daemon itself still verifies StoryCluster health before creating the Gun
client and starting the runtime.

## Env File Surface

Default env file:

```bash
~/.config/vhc/news-aggregator.env
```

Required or commonly used names:

```bash
VH_GUN_PEERS
VH_STORYCLUSTER_REMOTE_URL
VH_STORYCLUSTER_REMOTE_AUTH_TOKEN
VH_STORYCLUSTER_REMOTE_HEALTH_URL
OPENAI_API_KEY
VH_BUNDLE_SYNTHESIS_ENABLED
VH_BUNDLE_SYNTHESIS_RELAY_WRITE_ORIGINS
VH_BUNDLE_SYNTHESIS_RELAY_WRITE_REQUIRE_ALL
VH_BUNDLE_SYNTHESIS_WRITE_RELAY_REST
VH_RELAY_DAEMON_TOKEN
VH_NEWS_DAEMON_HOLDER_ID
VH_NEWS_RUNTIME_LEASE_TTL_MS
VH_NEWS_INGESTION_LEASE_SCOPE
VH_NEWS_DAEMON_STATE_DIR
VH_DAEMON_FEED_ARTIFACT_ROOT
VH_NEWS_DAEMON_LAST_SUCCESS_FILE
VH_NEWS_SYSTEM_WRITER_ID
VH_NEWS_SYSTEM_WRITER_PIN_JSON
VH_NEWS_SYSTEM_WRITER_PUBLIC_KEY_SPKI_BASE64URL
VH_NEWS_SYSTEM_WRITER_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8_BASE64URL
```

Do not paste values into tickets, PRs, or evidence docs.

## Lease / Lock Behavior

The daemon writes and renews the shared `NewsIngestionLease` before starting the
runtime. If another holder has a live lease, this daemon stops its runtime and
waits for the next leadership tick. On shutdown it attempts to release its lease.

Recommended production holder:

```bash
VH_NEWS_DAEMON_HOLDER_ID=vh-news-daemon:a6-public
```

## Relay Snapshot Freshness Watch

`tools/scripts/relay-latest-index-snapshot-watch.mjs` reads files only. It does
not call public HTTP latest-index routes.

Defaults:

- files:
  - `/home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-a/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json`
  - `/home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-b/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json`
  - `/home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-c/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json`
- schema: `vh-news-latest-index-relay-snapshot-v1`
- expected entries: `15`
- newest-entry age SLO: `21600000` ms (6 hours)
- timer cadence: 15 minutes

Manual run:

```bash
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_OUTPUT_FILE="$HOME/.local/state/vhc/relay-snapshot-watch/latest.json" \
node tools/scripts/relay-latest-index-snapshot-watch.mjs
```

Config knobs:

```bash
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_FILES
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_MAX_AGE_MS
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_EXPECTED_ENTRIES
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_MAX_FILE_BYTES
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_OUTPUT_FILE
VH_RELAY_SNAPSHOT_WATCH_SYSLOG
```

Failures exit nonzero and are logged to the user journal; by default the script
also sends a compact failure line to syslog via `logger`.

## Relay #638 Deploy Gate Packet

These commands are read-only until the final restart/deploy line. Do not run any
public latest-index HTTP probe before this packet proves the #638 relay image is
running.

Read-only precheck:

```bash
ssh ccibootstrap
sudo docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}' | grep -E 'vhc-relay|vhc-public-beta-origin'
sudo docker inspect vhc-relay-a vhc-relay-b vhc-relay-c >/tmp/vhc-relay-inspect.json
python3 <<'PY'
import json, sys
with open('/tmp/vhc-relay-inspect.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as handle:
    containers = json.load(handle)
for container in containers:
    env_names = sorted((entry.split('=', 1)[0] for entry in container.get('Config', {}).get('Env', [])))
    networks = sorted((container.get('NetworkSettings', {}).get('Networks') or {}).keys())
    mounts = [
        {'source': mount.get('Source'), 'destination': mount.get('Destination'), 'mode': mount.get('Mode')}
        for mount in container.get('Mounts', [])
    ]
    print(json.dumps({
        'name': container.get('Name', '').lstrip('/'),
        'image': container.get('Config', {}).get('Image'),
        'env_names': env_names,
        'mounts': mounts,
        'networks': networks,
    }, sort_keys=True))
PY
rm -f /tmp/vhc-relay-inspect.json
node /home/humble/VHC/tools/scripts/relay-latest-index-snapshot-watch.mjs
```

The precheck must show schema `vh-news-latest-index-relay-snapshot-v1`, `15`
entries for every relay snapshot, sane size/mtime, and newest-entry age under
the 6-hour SLO. Preserve the current relay image tags and inspect output for
rollback before restart.

Only after that direct disk precheck passes, use the existing host deploy pattern
for the relay image containing #638. If the host does not already have a clear
deploy command, stop and hand the operator the inspect output plus current image
tags rather than improvising.

Post-deploy safe proof:

```bash
sudo docker inspect vhc-relay-a vhc-relay-b vhc-relay-c --format '{{.Name}} image={{.Config.Image}}'
sha256sum /home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-{a,b,c}/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json
stat -c '%n %s %Y' /home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-{a,b,c}/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json
```

After host proof that #638 is actually running, then and only then run the safe
behavior probes from inside the host/network context:

```bash
curl -sS -i 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/vh/news/latest-index?limit=1&persist=true'
curl -sS -i 'http://127.0.0.1:8765/vh/news/latest-index?limit=1&persist=false'
sha256sum /home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-a/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json
stat -c '%n %s %Y' /home/humble/.local/share/vhc/vhc-relay-a/data/news-latest-index-snapshot.json
```

Expected:

- `persist=true` returns JSON HTTP 400.
- `persist=false` returns JSON and leaves snapshot hash, mtime, and content
  unchanged.

Repeat equivalent `persist=false` hash/mtime proof for relay B and C.

## Analysis Repoint Packet

Do not repoint production origin until `docs/ops/analysis-backend-3001.md` local
and host checks are green and the operator approves the env change.

Approved host packet:

```bash
cd /home/humble/VHC
git fetch origin main
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
./tools/scripts/install-analysis-backend-service.sh
curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/analyze/health
curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/analyze/config
curl -sS -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/analyze -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"prompt":"probe"}'
```

Then update the origin env var name only:

```bash
VH_PUBLIC_ORIGIN_ANALYSIS_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

Restart the origin through the existing host pattern and verify:

```bash
curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:<origin-port>/api/analyze/health
curl -sS -i http://127.0.0.1:<origin-port>/api/analyze/config
curl -sS -i https://venn.carboncaste.io/api/analyze/health
curl -sS -i https://venn.carboncaste.io/api/analyze/config
```

## Publisher Start Abort Criteria

Abort or stop the service if any of these occur:

- source-health preflight fails or reports non-pass release evidence;
- OpenAI preflight is not `pass`;
- StoryCluster health check fails;
- relay REST write fanout is below the configured `require_all` target;
- snapshot watch reports stale newest-entry age above 6 hours;
- latest content does not advance after approved start and expected ingest
  cadence.

After an approved start, release evidence still requires fresh content advance,
synthesis lifecycle/publication evidence, public canary, and soak. The service
starting successfully is not a release-ready claim.
