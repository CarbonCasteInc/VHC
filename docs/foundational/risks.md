# Risk Register (Deprecated)

Canonical risk tracking now lives in `docs/foundational/System_Architecture.md` §7.

This file is kept only for backward compatibility with older references.

Rules:
- Do not add new risks here.
- Add or update risks in `System_Architecture.md` §7.
- If a risk requires implementation-state context, cross-reference `docs/foundational/STATUS.md`.
